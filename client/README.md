# Transit Better 

A transit application built for helping commuters better time and plan their commute whether it'd be by bus, driving, walking, or transit. The application provides estimated ETA's, while retrieving their current location to show nearby bus stops and the scheduled times for the each bus at that bus stop. The application uses React in the frontend, express in the backend as well as PSQL for database for user authentication. The application also uses Google api as well as Here Api for route planning and map rendering. Currently, users are able to log-in and save their favourite addresses. Some use cases to be implemented in the future is to connect a fitness api to provide steps tracking and all fitness related information from the trip taken by the user.
